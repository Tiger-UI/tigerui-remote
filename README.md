# TigerUI - Remote
A library that adds support for interacting with remote properties to Tiger-UI.

## To work on this library
For the meantime until I upload a first release of [tigerui-core](https://github.com/Tiger-UI/tigerui-core) into a public repository and add that to the gradle dependencies you will need to also clone tigerui-core and add it as dependant project (module or whatever) in your IDE.
